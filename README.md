# OpenCV-SmallProjects

## Project 1:- Virtual Paint
Well Virtual Paint is for detecting colors and using coloured marker for random drawing virtually using simple openCV and numpy using PyCharm Python. For start we should check is openCV reading your webcam or not then only we can proceed in choosing and reading colors with specific color values.

## Project 2:- Document Scanner
Doc Scanner is just a small openCV project for scanning our document in which ever place it is been placed using our webcam and with right coordinates, some preProcessing and showing all preProcessed and our main document using stack images function in our python file at one place.

## Project 3:- Number Plate Detector
Number Plate Detector helps to detect number plates in cars in real time here we have used a sample video of 3 cars to detect number plates of 3 different cars. "haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml" helps to detect russian plate numbers then we can save each number plate in a seperate directory "Scanned" in Resources folder.
